INTRODUCTION ABOUT NoC
A Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a system that connects different parts of a 
computer chip, like processors and memory, so they can talk to each other. It 
uses small, fast paths to send data instead of long wires. NoC helps improve the 
performance of chips, especially when there are many components, like in 
modern multi-core processors.

Advantages of Network-on-Chip (NoC): 

Scalability: NoC allows easy addition of more components (like processors or 
memory) without significant performance loss, making it ideal for complex 
chips. "Efficiency: It improves communication speed and reduces power 
consumption compared to traditional wiring methods.
Modularity: Different parts of the chip can communicate independently, 
which makes design and troubleshooting easier.

Disadvantages of Network-on-Chip (NoC): 

Complex Design: Designing and managing the network can be complicated and 
time-consuming. "Cost: Implementing NoC on a chip can increase 
manufacturing costs due to the additional components and design complexity. 
"Latency": While NoC improves communication, it can still introduce some 
delay compared to direct connections between components.
Wireless Network-on-Chip (WiNoC): is a type of NoC where the 
communication between components on the chip is done wirelessly instead of 
using traditional wired connections. Wireless Communication: Data is 
transmitted using electromagnetic waves (like radio signals) between 
components rather than through physical wires. "Reduced Wires: This design 
reduces the complexity of wiring, especially as the number of components 
increases. "Flexibility": Wireless communication allows components to 
communicate without being directly connected by physical paths, offering more 
flexible chip designs.

How Wireless NoC Differs from Wired NoC

Wired NoC

1. Communication: 
    Uses physical wires for data transfer.Paths are fixed based on the wiring layout. 
2. Power Consumption: 
    Requires higher power to transmit signals over wires. 
3. Scalability: 
    Difficult to scale due to the increasing complexity of wiring as the network 
    grows. 
4. Latency: 
    Typically lower latency since signals travel directly through wires. 

Wireless NoC (WiNoC) 

1. Communication:
    Uses wireless signals (e.g., radio waves) for data transfer. 
    No physical connections are required between nodes. 
2. Flexibility: 
    More flexible as components can communicate without direct wiring. 
3. Power Consumption: 
    More power-efficient, especially for long-range communication. 
4. Scalability: 
    Easier to scale as it eliminates the need for additional wires when the network 
    size increases. 
5. Latency: 
    May have higher latency due to signal propagation delays and potential 
    interference. 

Building Blocks of NoC

1. Link 
    Connects two routers in the network. 
    Can be physical (wired) or logical (wireless) channels. 
2. Buffer 
    Temporarily stores packets when congestion occurs and prevents immediate 
    forwarding. Ensures smooth traffic flow. 
3. Flow Control 
    Manages the movement of packets
    Global Movement: Ensures packets are routed across the entire network 
                    efficiently.
    Local Movement: Controls packet transfer between adjacent nodes. 
4. Router 
    Contains input and output ports, a switching matrix, and a local port to connect 
    to the IP core.Includes logic blocks to handle routing, arbitration, and data flow control.
