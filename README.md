Analyzed existing traffic patterns in a Wireless Network-on-Chip (NoC) by varying key characteristics such as packet size, injection rate, and topology.Designed and implemented custom traffic pattern logic based on observations and performance metrics.Simulated the traffic behavior using a C++ compiler to evaluate latency, throughput, and network efficiency.
